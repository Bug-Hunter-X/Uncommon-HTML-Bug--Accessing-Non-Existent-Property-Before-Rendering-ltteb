This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to accessing an element's properties before it's fully rendered. The bug occurs when a script tries to access a non-existent property of an element before the browser has completed rendering the element in the DOM.  The solution demonstrates how to use the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the script executes only after the page is fully parsed.
